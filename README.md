  ## Installation: 
  To install, copy the code form the repo and use "git clone <paste copied information here>" to add the app to a directory
  
  ## Usage: 
  This app is for employees or managers that want to view non-sensitive date about the employees in their company. I would be particulary helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
